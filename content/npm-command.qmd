# NPM Command

## Init Project

```zsh
npm init -y
```

initializes a new Node.js project by creating a package.json file with default values. Let me break this down:

- `npm` is the Node Package Manager that comes with Node.js installation
- `init` is the command to create a new package.json file
- `-y` is a flag that automatically answers "yes" to all the prompts that would normally ask for project information

Without the `-y` flag, npm would interactively ask you questions about:

- Project name
- Version
- Description
- Entry point
- Test command
- Git repository
- Keywords
- Author
- License

The `-y` flag skips these questions and creates a package.json with default values based on your current directory name and other automatically determined information.
